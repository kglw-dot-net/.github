### Welcome to the Dev HQ of [KGLW.net]

We are fans of the band [King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard](https://kinggizzardandthelizardwizard.com/) who have swarmed to create **[KGLW.net]** â€” including a guide to the band's extensive discography; detailed information on concert setlists and links to recordings; analysis of the musical / lyrical / thematic analysis; and more!

The current KGLW.net site is "Phase 2" run and hosted via [Songfish](https://songfishapp.com).

This GitHub org contains the "Phase 1" site, as well as the code for [KGLW.today](https://kglw.today), and [a plugin](https://github.com/kglw-dot-net/discourse-plugin-gizzard-setlist) used in [the KGLW.net Forum](https://forum.kglw.net).
